# Hands-On-with-Linux-Internals
This repository hosts the first assignment for the CS695 course, Spring 2023-24, 
aimed at diving deep into Linux internals. The assignment is divided into three main sections: 
creating and exploring Linux Kernel Modules (LKMs), implementing ioctl system calls, and working with the /proc filesystem.
